Hi everyone, I make this ping pong game using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT .
It includes the following features:
Constants for game elements and variables to track scores, maximum score, and ball position.
The moveRods function to handle the movement of rods based on ARROW KEY inputs.
The moveBall function to handle the movement of the ball, including collision detection with the rods and walls.
Handling game over conditions, displaying the winner and score, and updating the highest score in local storage.
The resetGame function to reset the game state.
The startGame function to start the game on Enter key press, displaying the highest score and player or indicating it's the first time playing.
Additionally, the initial positions for the rods and ball are set, and an event listener is added to start the game on Enter key press.
